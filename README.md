Assignment 10 - 06-02-2025
dive into object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, which help create reusable and maintainable code. Exception handling, using try, catch, and custom exceptions, manages errors effectively. The Collections Framework provides efficient ways to store and manipulate data with structures like List, Set, and Map. Multithreading allows for concurrent programming, while file I/O enables reading and writing files. Java frameworks like Spring and Hibernate enhance development, and Java 8’s lambda expressions and Stream API simplify data processing. Understanding the JVM helps optimize performance, making Java a powerful language for scalable applications.

Assignment 11 - 07-02-2025
By working on these Java programs, I can master key OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and interfaces. I'll learn how to design hierarchical class structures by modeling real-world scenarios like educational courses, bank accounts, school roles, restaurant systems, and vehicles. Through inheritance, I’ll be able to reuse code efficiently, while method overriding will help me customize behavior in subclasses.

Assignment 12 - 10-02-2025
gained a strong understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java. By working on real-world scenarios like employee management, e-commerce, and banking systems, I learned how to apply encapsulation to protect sensitive data, ensuring access is controlled through getter and setter methods. Through inheritance, I was able to reuse common logic in abstract classes while allowing subclasses to customize specific behaviors. Implementing polymorphism helped me process different object types dynamically, making my code more flexible and scalable. I also explored interfaces to define contracts for different functionalities, reinforcing the principle of composition over inheritance. Additionally, I practiced constructor chaining, access modifiers, and modular class design, all of which contribute to writing clean and maintainable code. This project gave me hands-on experience with OOP best practices and prepared me to tackle real-world software development challenges efficiently.

Assignment 14 - 13-02-2025 A practical approach to mastering linked lists in Java. The singly linked list manages student records, the doubly linked list handles movie data with bidirectional traversal, and the circular linked list enables efficient task scheduling. These implementations strengthen core data structure concepts and real-world problem-solving skills, making them a great foundation for advanced learning.

Assignment 15 - 13-02-2025 understand how stacks, queues, and hash maps work in solving real-world problems efficiently. They learn when to use each structure, optimize operations, handle edge cases, and ensure thread safety. By implementing these concepts in Java, they improve problem-solving skills and coding efficiency while gaining practical experience with fundamental data structures.

Assignment 15 - 14-02-2025 Made java codes of various types of sorting algorithmns and understand how they are implemented on different real life scenarios.

Assignment 16 - 15-02-2025 This assignment helped me understand key Java concepts like StringBuilder, StringBuffer, and FileReader through practical coding exercises. The best practices section clarified when to use each approach, and the problems reinforced my learning. Comparing StringBuilder and StringBuffer was especially insightful for understanding performance differences. Also the questions of Liner search and binary Search are extremely good.

Assignment 17 - 17-02-2025 Learnt about the computational power of diffrent types of algorithms on large datasets like binary search vs Linear search and also compared them for the best suited algorithm in different situations.

Assignment 18 - 18-02-2025 Gain a strong understanding of generic programming in Java, including the use of generic classes, methods, and bounded type parameters to write flexible and type-safe code. They will also learn how to apply wildcards (? extends Type) for handling different subclasses dynamically. Additionally, the assignments reinforce key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation, helping students design modular and reusable components

Assignment 19 - 20-02-2025 Very good matrial for understanding generic data structures like hashset, hashmap, queue. Got a very good understanding of different algorithms overall the matrial is very good.

Assignment 20 - 21-02-2025 Got a very good understanding of exception hal in java questions are very good and very much scenario based to gasp the exact concepts.

Assignment 21 - 22-02-2025 Got a very good understanding of regex and unit testing the questions were very elaborated and conseptual. Regex questions were very good and I had never done thease kind of questions of regex ever.
